# React Native Concepts

Simple React Native project to practice the concepts of React Native. The idea of this project is to access the backend developed in another challenge and to be able to list and like repositories.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Emulator(Android / iOS) or a device to run the app. 
Node: version 12 or higher
Yarn: version 1

### Installing

After you clone this repository, enter the repository folder and run on the terminal:
```
yarn
```
If you decide to use iOS emulator, you'll have to navigate to ios folder in the project, then execute the following command: 
```
pod install
```
this will install all iOS dependencies.

To start the app, run this command:

```
yarn react-native start
```

After that, if you are using an android emulator, you'll have to run:
```
yarn react-native run-android
```
After that, if you are using an iOS emulator, you'll have to run:
```
yarn react-native run-ios
```

## Running the tests

If you want to test any implementation, you should be able to run:

```
yarn test
```

### Break down into end to end tests

The tests are going to verify if it's possible to give a like to a certain repository.
